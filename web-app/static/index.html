                        Ranked Choice Voting (RCV) helps to elect a candidate
                        who reflects a majority of voters in a single election
                        even when several viable candidates are in the race. RCV
                        is a way to ensure elections are fair for all voters. It
                        allows voters the option to rank candidates in order of
                        preference: one, two, three, and so forth.

                    <div>
                        This calculator is for races where voters select one
                        winner. If a candidate receives more than half of the
                        first choices, that candidate wins, just like in any
                        other election. However, if there is no majority winner
                        after counting first choices, the race is decided by an
                        "instant runoff." The candidate with the fewest votes is
                        eliminated, and voters who picked that candidate as
                        ‘number 1’ will have their votes count for their next
                        choice. This process continues until there’s a majority
                        winner or a candidate won with more than half of the
                        vote.
